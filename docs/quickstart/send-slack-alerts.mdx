Elementary has a Slack integration to send alerts about failures in dbt tests, Elementary tests, models runs and snapshots runs.

The alerts include information for fast triage.
Also, you can add configuration for each test / model in your `.yml` files:

- Custom channels - distribute alerts based on their context
- Owners - tag the owner of the model
- Subscribers - let users subscribe to models and tests they care about
- dbt Tags - add custom context to the alert

Before you can start sending alerts, make sure to complete the steps dbt package installation, including executing `dbt run` with the Elementary package models.
This is **required for the tests to work.**

## Add connection profile for elementary CLI

In order to connect, elementary needs a profile in a file named `profiles.yml`

- Path: `HOME_DIR/.dbt/profiles.yml`
- Profile name: `elementary`
- Schema name: The schema of elementary models, default is `<your_dbt_project_schema>_elementary`

<SnippetGroup>

```yml Snowflake
## SNOWFLAKE ##
## By default, edr expects the profile name 'elementary'.      ##
## Configure the database and schema of elementary models.     ##
## Check where 'elementary_test_results' is to find it.        ##

elementary:
outputs:
default:
type: snowflake
account: [account id]

      ## User/password auth, other options (Keypair/SSO) require other configs ##
      user: [username]
      password: [password]

      role: [user role]
      database: [database name]
      warehouse: [warehouse name]
      schema: [schema name]_elementary
      threads: 4

```

```yml BigQuery
## BIGQUERY ##
## By default, edr expects the profile name 'elementary'.      ##

## Setup Slack Integration

<SetupSlackIntegration />

## Execute the CLI

Make sure to run the following command after your dbt runs and tests:

```
edr monitor
```

---

## Alert types configuration

By default, the alerts that are sent are failed tests, errored models and errored snapshots.
You can choose to disable alert types by adding a var to your `dbt_project.yml`.

```yml dbt_project.yml
vars:
  # Alerts configuration vars   #
  # All set to false by default #
  elementary:
    disable_model_alerts: false
    disable_test_alerts: false
    disable_warn_alerts: false
```

## Customize alerts: owners, tags and subscribers

Elementary enriches alerts with dbt model/source/snapshot owners and tags ([see dbt's docs to learn more](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/meta#designate-a-model-owner)).
Also, you can use two custom Elementary fields:

- Subscribers: to tag additional users except the owner in an alert.
- Channel: to send the alert to additional Slack channel (only available for Slack token).

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Owners">
If you want to tag a model owner in a slack alert:
- Use '@' and the email prefix of your slack user (find the user's email from your Slack workspace to make sure it is the email this user has been registered with to Slack)
- For example, if we want to tag a user named Jessica with an email jessica.jones@marvel.com in our Slack workspace, simply add the email prefix (with lower case) jessica.jones as follows to your model schema.yml / properties.yml

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: my_model_name
    meta:
      owner: "@jessica.jones"
```

It is possible to tag multiple owners as well:

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: my_model_name
    meta:
      owner: ["@jessica.jones", "@joe.joseph"]
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tags">
if you want to tag a group or a channel in a slack alert:

- Add it as model tag and use '#' as the prefix of the channel name.
- For example, to tag the marketing team's data ops channel add the following to your `model schema.yml` / `properties.yml`.

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: my_model_name
    meta:
      owner: "@jessica.jones"
      tags: ["#marketing-data-ops"]
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Subscribers">
If you want to tag users on a model / test / snapshot failure alert:
- Use '@' and the email prefix of your slack user (find the user's email from your Slack workspace to make sure it is the email this user has been registered with to Slack) For example, if we want to tag a user named Jessica with an email jessica.jones@marvel.com in our Slack workspace, use "@jessica.jones".
- Add 'subscribers' under a meta field to your properties.yml file.

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: my_model_name
    meta:
      subscribers: "@jessica.jones"
    columns:
      - name: column_name
        tests:
          - unique:
              meta:
                subscribers: "@luke.cage"
```

It is possible to tag multiple subscribers as well:

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: my_model_name
    meta:
      subscribers: ["@jessica.jones", "@luke.cage"]
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom Slack channel">
By default Elementary uses the Slack channel that was configured in the Slack integration.
Elementary supports configuring custom slack channels that are configured on your models / sources and snapshots.
If you configure a custom slack channel for a model, all the test alerts that belong to this model will be sent to this custom slack channel as well.

For example, this enables you to duplicate all your marketing model and test alerts to a specific marketing-data-ops channel.

To set it up, simply add the relevant channel to your models in the properties.yml (can be done also for sources and snapshots).

```yml properties.yml
models:
  - name: marketing_leads
    meta:
      channel: marketing_data_ops
```

If your models are in folders by department / team, another useful option is to configure the channel in your `dbt_project.yml` file.

```yml dbt_project.yml
models:
  marketing_bi:
    +meta:
      +channel: marketing_data_ops
```

</Accordion>

## Continuous alerting

In order to monitor continuously, use your orchestrator to execute it regularly (we recommend running it right after your dbt job ends to monitor the latest data updates).
