title: "Setup Slack alerts"
---

Elementary has a Slack integration to send alerts about:
- Failures and/or of dbt tests
- Failures and/or Elementary tests
- Model runs failures
- Source freshness issues

You can enrich your alerts by adding properties to tests and models in your `.yml` files. 
The supported attributes are: description, tags, owner, subscribers.

You can configure and customize your alerts by configuring: 
custom channel, alert fields, alert grouping, alert filters, suppression interval.

## Setup Slack Integration

<Info>

**Before you start**

Before you can start using the alerts, make sure to install the dbt package, configure a profile and install the CLI.
This is **required for the alerts to work.**

1. A working Python installation
2. [pip installer](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for Python
3. Access and credentials to a data warehouse supported by Elementary

We also recommend you work with a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

## Execute the CLI

Make sure to run the following command after your dbt runs and tests:

```
edr monitor --slack-token <your_slack_token> --slack-channel-name <slack_channel_to_post_at> --group-by [table | alert]
```

Or just `edr monitor` if you used `config.yml`.

## Alert on source freshness failures

_Not supported in dbt cloud_

To alert on source freshness, you will need to run `edr run-operation upload-source-freshness` right after each execution of `dbt source freshness`.
This operation will upload the results to a table, and the execution of `edr monitor` will send the actual alert.
- Note that it needs to be from the same machine.
- Note that this requires passing `--project-dir` argument.


## Continuous alerting

In order to monitor continuously, use your orchestrator to execute it regularly (we recommend running it right after
your dbt job ends to monitor the latest data updates).
