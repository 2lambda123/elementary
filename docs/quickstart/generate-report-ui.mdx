Elementary [data observability report](../understand-elementary/elementary-report-ui) can be used for visualization and exploration of data from the dbt-package tables. That includes dbt test results, Elementary anomaly detection results, dbt artifacts, tests runs, etc.

Before you can start using the report, make sure to complete the steps dbt package installation, including executing `dbt run` with the Elementary package models.
This is **required for the tests to work.**

## Add connection profile for elementary CLI

In order to connect, elementary needs a profile in a file named `profiles.yml`

- Path: `HOME_DIR/.dbt/profiles.yml`
- Profile name: `elementary`
- Schema name: The schema of elementary models, default is `<your_dbt_project_schema>_elementary`

<SnippetGroup>

```yml Snowflake
## SNOWFLAKE ##
## By default, edr expects the profile name 'elementary'.      ##
## Configure the database and schema of elementary models.     ##
## Check where 'elementary_test_results' is to find it.        ##

elementary:
outputs:
default:
type: snowflake
account: [account id]

      ## User/password auth, other options (Keypair/SSO) require other configs ##
      user: [username]
      password: [password]

      role: [user role]
      database: [database name]
      warehouse: [warehouse name]
      schema: [schema name]  # elementary schema, usually [schema name]_elementary
      threads: 4

```

```yml BigQuery
## BIGQUERY ##
## By default, edr expects the profile name 'elementary'.      ##
## Configure the database and schema of elementary models.     ##
## Check where 'elementary_test_results' is to find it.        ##

elementary:
  outputs:
    default:
      type: bigquery

      ## Service account auth, other options require other configs ##
      method: service-account
      keyfile: [full path to your keyfile]

      project: [project id]
      dataset: [dataset name]  # elementary dataset, usually [dataset name]_elementary
      threads: 4
      location: [dataset location]
      priority: interactive
```

```yml Redshift
## REDSHIFT ##
## By default, edr expects the profile name 'elementary'.      ##
## Configure the database and schema of elementary models.     ##
## Check where 'elementary_test_results' is to find it.        ##

elementary:
  outputs:
    default:
      type: redshift
      host: [hostname, like hostname.region.redshift.amazonaws.com]

      ## User/password auth, other options (IAM) require other configs ##
      user: [username]
      password: [password]

      dbname: [database name]
      schema: [schema name]  # elementary schema, usually [schema name]_elementary
      threads: 4
      keepalives_idle: 240 # default 240 seconds
      connect_timeout: 10 # default 10 seconds
      # search_path: public # optional, not recommended
      sslmode: [optional, set the sslmode used to connect to the database (in case this parameter is set, will look for ca in ~/.postgresql/root.crt)]
      ra3_node: true # enables cross-database sources
```

## Generate Tests Report UI

### Execute `edr monitor report` in your shell

After installing and configuring the CLI, execute the command:

```shell
edr monitor report
```

The command will use the provided connection profile to access the data warehouse, read from the Elementary tables, and generate the report as an HTML file.
