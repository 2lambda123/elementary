Elementary has a report for visualization and exploration of data from the dbt-package tables, which includes dbt test results, Elementary anomaly detection results, dbt artifacts, tests runs, etc.

In order to visualize the data from the [dbt-package](../project-overview/contributions#guide-on-contributing-to-the-dbt-package) tables, you can use the [CLI](../understand-elementary/cli-install) to generate the Elementary report.

## Instructions to generate reports

### Install the Elementary CLI

To install the monitor module run:

```
pip install elementary-data
```

Run one of the following commands based on your platform (no need to run all):

```
pip install 'elementary-data[snowflake]'
pip install 'elementary-data[bigquery]'
pip install 'elementary-data[redshift]'
```

Run `edr --help` in order to ensure the installation was successful.

If you're receiving `command not found: edr` please check our [troubleshooting guide](../general/troubleshooting).

### Add connection profile for elementary CLI

In order to connect, elementary needs a profile in a file named `profiles.yml`

- Path: `HOME_DIR/.dbt/profiles.yml`

- Profile name: `elementary`

- Schema name: the default schema elementary uses is `<your_dbt_project_schema>_elementary`

- If you want to change the schema elementary uses, please see [install & configuration](../quickstart#install-the-dbt-package)

### Execute dbt command

```shell
dbt run --select elementary
```

Before you can start using Elementary CLI, execute `dbt run` with the [Elementary package](../understand-elementary/dbt-package) models, which are **required for Elementary CLI features to work.**

This will create mostly empty tables, that will be updated by the tests executions.
The fact that the tables are empty means that there will be **minimal to no performance impact** on your dbt runs.

## Generate Tests Report UI

### Execute `edr monitor report` in your shell

After installing and configuring the CLI, execute the command:

```shell
edr monitor report
```

The command will use the provided connection profile to access the data warehouse, read from the Elementary tables, and generate the report as an HTML file.
