## Add connection profile for elementary CLI

In order to connect, elementary needs a profile in a file named `profiles.yml`

- Path: `HOME_DIR/.dbt/profiles.yml`
- Profile name: `elementary`
- Schema name: The schema of elementary models, default is `<your_dbt_project_schema>_elementary`

<AllProfiles />

## Generate Tests Report UI

### Execute `edr monitor report` in your shell

After installing and configuring the CLI, execute the command:

```shell
edr monitor report
```

The command will use the provided connection profile to access the data warehouse, read from the Elementary tables, and generate the report as an HTML file.
