title: "Add Elementary tests"
---

Before you can start using Elementary monitors as tests, execute `dbt run` with the Elementary package models, which are **required for the tests to work.**

## Run the following command

```shell
dbt run --select elementary
```

This will mostly create empty tables, that will be updated by the tests executions.
The fact that the tables are empty means that there will be **minimal to no performance impact** on your dbt runs.

## Add and configure the monitors as tests from within your dbt project:

After you install the dbt package in your project, the following tests will be available for you to use just like native dbt tests:

** Model / Source tests:**

`elementary.table_anomalies`

`elementary.all_columns_anomalies`

`elementary.schema_changes`

** Column test: **

`elementary.column_anomalies`

For additional tests configuration and options, refer to [configure monitoring](../guides/elementary-tests-configuration) and [add monitors as tests](../guides/add-data-monitoring-tests).

Add and configure the monitors as tests from within your dbt project:

## What happens on each test?

On each test elementary package executes the relevant monitors, and searches for anomalies by comparing to historical metrics.
At the end of the `dbt test` run, all results and collected metrics are merged into the elementary models:

- **data_monitoring_metrics** - All metrics collected by elementary tests.

- **alert_data_monitoring** - Anomalies detected by elementary anomaly detection tests.

- **alert_schema_changes** - Schema changes detected by elementary schema changes test.
