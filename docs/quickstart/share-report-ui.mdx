## Distribute

Generate and distribute the report to external platforms by using the command `edr send-report`.
You can specify more than one platform in the command, and the report will be sent to all.
All arguments can be passed either as CLI arguments or in the `config.yml` file.

### Send over Slack

After you [set up a Slack app and token](/integrations/slack#slack-integration-setup) you can run the command:

```shell
edr send-report --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME>
```

You can control the name of the report by providing `--slack-file-name <REPORT_NAME>` to the `edr send-report`
command. Make sure the report name you provided ends with `.html`.

#### Configuration

If you prefer to use `config.yml` file, you can add the following configuration instead of the CLI arguments:

```yml
slack:
  token: [Slack token]
  channel_name: [Slack channel]
```

### Host

<Accordion title="Amazon S3">

The prerequisites are to
have [AWS access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html) and
an [S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html).

If you already have
a [`~/.aws/credentials`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-where)
file, you can run the command and provide only the profile name and the bucket's name:

```shell
edr send-report --aws-profile-name <AWS_PROFILE> --s3-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

Alternatively, you can pass the access key ID and secret access key:

```shell
edr send-report --aws-access-key-id <ACCESS_KEY_ID> --aws-secret-access-key <SECRET_ACCESS_KEY> --s3-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

You can control the location of the report in the bucket by providing `--bucket-file-path <REPORT_PATH>` to
the `edr send-report` command. Make sure the report's file name ends with `.html`.

#### Hosting the report as a website

You can host the report as the bucket's website so that you can browse to it with a constant URL
like `https://<Elementary-Report-Bucket>.s3-website.<Region>.amazonaws.com`.
In order to do that, you'll need to complete **steps 1-4** on
the [configure a website on the bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html)
guide.
After you've completed it, pass `--update-bucket-website true` to `send-report` in order to update the main page of
the bucket's website.

#### Configuration

If you prefer to use `config.yml` file, you can add the following configuration instead of the CLI arguments:

```yml
aws:
  profile_name: [AWS profile name]
  s3_bucket_name: [S3 bucket name]

update_bucket_website: [true | false]
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Google Cloud Storage (GCS)">

The prerequisite is to have a [GCS bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets).  
Once you have it, you'll need to provide one of two ways to authenticate:

#### [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) (Recommended)

you can send the report to your GCS bucket by running the command:

```shell
edr send-report --google-service-account-path <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH> --gcs-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

#### OAuth using `gcloud`

If you're using OAuth with `gcloud`, simply omit `--google-service-account-path`:

```shell
edr send-report --gcs-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME>
```

You can control the location of the report in the bucket by providing `--bucket-file-path <REPORT_PATH>` to
the `edr send-report` command. Make sure the report's file name ends with `.html`.

#### Hosting the report as a website

You can host the report as the bucket's website so that you can browse to it with a constant URL
like `https://storage.googleapis.com/<Elementary-Report-Bucket>/index.html`.
Here's [an example](https://storage.googleapis.com/elementary_static/elementary_demo.html).
In order to do that, pass `--update-bucket-website true` to `send-report` in order to update the `index.html` file in
the bucket.

_Note_: You might want to [limit or grant access](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control) to your reports
bucket to certain users.

#### Configuration

If you prefer to use `config.yml` file, you can add the following configuration instead of the CLI arguments:

```yml
google:
  service_account_path: [Google service account path]
  gcs_bucket_name: [GCS bucket name]

update_bucket_website: [true | false]
```

## Test results summary

When distributing the report to external platforms, elementary generates a summary of the report's test results.
The test results summary can only be distributed using Slack.
To enable distribution of the test results summary when distributing the report, please follow the following steps:

### Send over Slack

Supported automaticaly.

### Host

To enable distributing the test results summary, you need to config Slack platform as well.
After you [set up a Slack app and token](/integrations/slack#slack-integration-setup) you can run the command:

<Accordion title="Amazon S3">

```shell
edr send-report --aws-profile-name <AWS_PROFILE> --s3-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME> --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME>
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Google Cloud Storage (GCS)">

```shell
edr send-report --google-service-account-path <SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH> --gcs-bucket-name <BUCKET_NAME> --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME>
```

</Accordion>

### Configuration

Possible configurations:

#### Disable HTML attachment

If you wish to share only the test results summary, you can disable the report attachment using `disable` config:

```shell
edr send-report --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME> --disable html_attachment
```

#### Include descriptions

By default the test results summary does not include the discriptions of test.
You can include them using `include` config:

```shell
edr send-report --slack-token <SLACK_TOKEN> --slack-channel-name <CHANNEL_NAME> --include descriptions
```
