Monitor your data warehouse in minutes, and **be the first to know of data issues**. Gain immediate
**visibility, monitor** your data and operation**, detect** data issues, and understand the **impact
and root cause.**

- **Data observability UI ([live demo](https://www.elementary-data.com/data-observability-demo))**

  Triage anomalies and dbt tests in a UI that visualizes results and provides all the information you need in a single place.

- **Data anomalies monitoring as dbt tests**

Continuous monitoring of data quality metrics, freshness, volume and schema changes, including anomaly detection, configured and executed as dbt tests.

- **dbt artifacts uploader**

Collect dbt artifacts, runs and test results as part of your runs.

- **Slack alerts**
  Get informative notifications on data issues, schema changes, jobs and tests failures.

- **Data lineage made simple, reliable, and automated**
  Tracing the actual upstream & downstream dependencies in the data warehouse.

## Quickstart

[Quick start: Data monitoring as abt tests in minutes.](/quickstart-data-monitoring)

[Quick start: Data lineage.](/quickstart-data-lineage)

## Demo

**Data anomalies monitoring as dbt tests -** [sandbox](https://www.elementary-data.com/data-observability-demo) and [demo video](https://www.elementary-data.com/demo).

**Data lineage** - try out our [sandbox here](https://www.elementary-data.com/live-demo).

## How it works?

For the data monitoring and dbt artifacts collection, we developed a [dbt package](/quickstart-data-monitoring#install-the-dbt-package).
The monitoring configuration is configured in your dbt project, and the monitors are dbt macros and models. All the collected data is saved to an elementary schema in your DWH.

[Elementary CLI](/cli-install#install-and-configure) is used to generate the UI report and send Slack alerts.

## Data anomalies monitoring as dbt tests

Elementary delivers **data monitoring and anomaly detection as [dbt tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests).**
Elementary dbt tests are [data monitors](/data-anomaly-detection#tests-and-monitors-types) that collect metrics and metadata over time.
On each execution, the tests analyze the new data, compare it to historical metrics, and [alert](/slack) on [anomalies](/data-anomaly-detection#anomaly-detection) and outliers.
**Elementary data monitors as tests are configured and executed like native tests in your project!**
