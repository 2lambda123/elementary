To start using **Elementary data monitors as test dbt tests**, you need to add our package to your dbt project.

  <summary className="font-medium cursor-default select-none text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">What are dbt packages and packages.yml?</summary>

A dbt package is additional Jinja and SQL code that is added to your project, for additional functionality. In fact, each package is a dbt project. By adding a package to your project, you are adding the package code to be part of your project, you can reference it's macros, execute it's models, and so on.

Add packages to your project by creating a 'packages.yml' file under the main project directory (where your 'dbt_project.yml is), and adding the relevant package. After you add a new package, run dbt deps to actually pull it's code to your project. This is also how you update packages.
Some packages we recommend you check out: [dbt_utils](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/tree/0.8.2/), [dbt_date](https://github.com/calogica/dbt-date/tree/0.5.4/), [codegen](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/tree/0.5.0/).

## Install the dbt package

### Add the following to your 'packages.yml' file and run the 'dbt deps' command

```yml packages.yml
packages:
  - package: elementary-data/elementary
    version: 0.4.2
    ## compatible with Elementary CLI version 0.4.2
    ## CLI: https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary
    ## see docs: https://docs.elementary-data.com/
```

### Add to your `dbt_project.yml`

<TipInfo>
  This means Elementary will use `your_schema_elementary` as its schema.
</TipInfo>

```yml dbt_project.yml
models:
  ## elementary models will be created in the schema '<your_schema>_elementary'
  ## when you add a profile for CLI alerts, make sure to configure this schema and db
  ## see docs: https://docs.elementary-data.com/
  elementary:
    +schema: "elementary"

on-run-end:
  - "{{ elementary.upload_dbt_artifacts(results) }}"
```

<TipInfo>

**Materialization**: For elementary to work, it needs to create some of the models as incremental tables. Make sure that there are no global materialization configurations that affect elementary, such as:

```
materialized: "{{ 'table' if target.name == 'prod-cloud' else 'view' }}"
```

Make sure to place the 'elementary' configuration under the models key, and other configs under your project name.

</TipInfo>

### Execute dbt command

```shell Terminal
dbt run --select elementary
```

This will mostly create empty tables, that will be updated with artifacts, metrics and test results in your future dbt executions.

## dbt artifacts & run results

Once the elementary dbt package has been installed and configured, your test results, your dbt run results and [dbt artifacts](../data-monitoring/dbt-artifacts) will be loaded to elementary models.

Some models are updated by an on-run-end hook when you run `dbt run / test / build`, and some only when you run the model:

- **On run end:**
  - **elementary_test_results** - Results of all dbt tests (including elementary and other packages, such as dbt_expectations and dbt_utils).
  - **dbt_run_results** - Results of all dbt executions.
- **`dbt run` that includes elementary models:**
  - **dbt_models, dbt_tests, dbt_sources, dbt_exposures, dbt_metrics** - Metadata and configuration. It is recommended to run these models when you make changes in your projects.

If you see data in these models you completed the package deployment (Congrats!ðŸŽ‰)

### What's next?

1. [â€‹Add anomaly detection as dbt tests](../guides/tests)ðŸ“ˆ
2. [â€‹Install the Elementary CLI](../guides/generate-reports#install-the-elementary-cli) to:

   - [â€‹Visualize all dbt test results and runs in a report](../guides/generate-reports)âœ¨

   - [Send informative Slack alerts](../guides/slack-alerts)ðŸ“£
