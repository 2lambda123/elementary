title: "Data anomaly detection"
---

Elementary dbt package includes **data monitoring and anomaly detection as [dbt tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests)**. The tests collect data quality metrics. On each execution, the latest metrics are compared to historical values to detect anomalies.
These tests are configured and executed like any other tests in your project.

## What happens on each test?

Upon running a test, your data is split into time buckets based on the `time_bucket` field and is limited by
the `days_back` var. The test then compares a certain metric (e.g. row count) of the buckets that are within the detection
period (`backfill_days`) to the row count of all the previous time buckets.
If there were any anomalies in the detection period, the test will fail.
On each test elementary package executes the relevant monitors, and searches for anomalies by comparing to historical
metrics.
At the end of the `dbt test` run, all results and collected metrics are merged into the elementary models.

## What does it mean when a test fails?

When a test fail, it means that an anomaly was detected on this metric and dataset.

## Tests and monitors types

### What are data monitors?

Data monitors are SQL queries generators that are executed to collect a specific metric of the data, and track it over time.

### How do monitors work in Elementary data tests?

Monitors have two modes:

#### Time buckets

If a `timestamp_column` is defined for the table, the monitor will collect metrics by timeframe buckets. It is highly recommended to use time buckets on every table that has a time field. This is both for performance reasons, as well as better anomaly detection.

The _default time bucket is 24 hours_.

#### Global

If there is no timestamp column configured, monitors will query on the entire table, in intervals that are at least the duration of the timeframe bucket.

### Available monitors

#### Table level monitors

| Monitor name |
| ------------ |
| `freshness`  |
| `row_count`  |

#### Column level monitors

| Property             | Column Type |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| `null_count`         | any         |
| `null_percent`       | any         |
| `min_length`         | string      |
| `max_length`         | string      |
| `average_length`     | string      |
| `missing_count`      | string      |
| `missing_percent`    | string      |
| `min`                | numeric     |
| `max`                | numeric     |
| `zero_count`         | numeric     |
| `zero_percent`       | numeric     |
| `standard_deviation` | numeric     |
| `variance`           | numeric     |
| `sum`                | numeric     |

#### Dimension monitors

Dimension monitors the frequency of field values (row count for groups based on given columns/expressions).

## Anomaly detection

Elementary uses "[standard score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score)", also known as "Z-score" for anomaly detection. This score represents the number of standard deviations of a value from the average of a set of values.

According to the [empirical rule](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/empirical-rule-2/), in a standard normal distribution:

- **~68%** of values have an absolute **z-score of 1 or less.**
- **~95%** of values have an absolute **z-score of 2 or less.**
- **~99.7%** of values have an absolute **z-score of 3 or less.**

Values with a **standard score of 3 and above are [considered outliers](https://www.ctspedia.org/do/view/CTSpedia/OutLier)**, and this is a recommended threshold for anomaly detection.
This is the default Elementary uses as well, and it can be changed using the var `anomaly_score_threshold` in the [global configuration](/guides/elementary-tests-configuration).

You can use the model `anomaly_sensitivity` to see if values of metrics from your last run would have been considered anomalies in different scores. **This can help you decide if there is a need to adjust the sensitivity:**
