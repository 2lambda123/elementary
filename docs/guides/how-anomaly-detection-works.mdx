Elementary dbt package includes **anomaly detection tests, implemented as [dbt tests](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests)**.
These tests can detect anomalies in volume, freshness, null rates, and anomalies in specific dimensions, among others.
The tests are configured and executed like any other tests in your project.

## What happens on each test?

Upon running a test, your data is split into time buckets based on the `time_bucket` field and is limited by the `days_back` var. 
The test then compares a certain metric (e.g. row count) of the buckets that are within the detection period (`backfill_days`) to the row count of all the previous time buckets within the `days_back` period.
If there were any anomalies in the detection period, the test will fail.

On each test elementary package executes the relevant monitors, and searches for anomalies by comparing to historical metrics.
