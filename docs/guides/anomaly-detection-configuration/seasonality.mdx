`seasonality: day_of_week`

Some data sets have patterns that repeat over a time period, and are expected. 
This is the normal behavior of these data sets. 
This means that when we try to detect outliers from the normal and expected range, ignoring this patterns might cause false positives or make us miss anomalies. 
The seasonality configuration is used to overcome this challenge and account for expected patterns. 


For example - Many data sets have lower volume over the weekend, and higher volume over the week days. 
This means that the expected range for different days of the week is different. 
The `day_of_week` seasonality uses the same day of week as a training set for each daily time bucket data point. 
The expected range for Monday will be based on a training set of previous Mondays, and so on.


- _Default: none_
- _Relevant tests: Anomaly detection tests with `timestamp_column` and 1 day `time_bucket`_
- _Configuration level: test_

#### Configuration example

<CodeGroup>

```yaml test
models:
  - name: this_is_a_model
    tests:
      - elementary.volume_anomalies:
          seasonality: day_of_week
```
