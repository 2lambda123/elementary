title: "Tests with Elementary"
---

Now after we setup our tutorial environment, we will add tests and run elementary.

## Add tests

The tutorial project has 3 models:

- customers
- orders
- returned orders

We will add different type of tests to monitor our project.

We can see the description of each model and it's columns at the `schema.yml` of the tutorial project, which we can find at `<tutorial cloned repository path>/elementary_tutorial/dbt_project/models/schema.yml`.

<Accordion title="schema.yml">

#### 1. Table anomalies - customers

We want to add a test that monitors anomalous of customers signups each day.
To do so, we will use Elementary's test `elementary.table_anomalies`.
Each customer is unique, and each customer has it's signup date, so we need to define table anomalies row count over the signup date.

Lets define the table anomalis test first:

```yaml
models:
  - name: customers
    description: This table has basic information about a customer, as well as some derived facts based on a customer's orders
    config:
      tags: ["PII"]
    tests:
      - elementary.table_anomalies:
          table_anomalies:
            - row_count
```

Now that we defined the table anomalies row count test, lets define the timestamp column the test will run over:

```yaml
models:
  - name: customers
    description: This table has basic information about a customer, as well as some derived facts based on a customer's orders
    config:
      tags: ["PII"]
      elementary:
        timestamp_column: "signup_date"
    tests:
      - elementary.table_anomalies:
          table_anomalies:
            - row_count
```

Now when we will run the test, it will gather row count metrics partioned over signup_date column.
In case we will have an anomaly at the amount of customers over the signup date, the test will fail.

#### 2. Table anomalies - returned orders

We want to add a test that monitors anomalous of returned orders each day.
To do so, we will use Elementary's test `elementary.table_anomalies`.

Lets define the table anomalies test.
It will be similar to the customers table anomalies test, but this time we will define the timestamp column at the test level (instead of the model level):

```yaml
  - name: returned_orders
    description: This table contains all of the returned orders
    config:
      tags: ["finance"]

    tests:
      - elementary.table_anomalies:
          tags: ["table_anomalies"]
          table_anomalies:
            - row_count
          timestamp_column: "order_date"
```

#### 3. Schema changes - customers

We want to add a test that monitors on schema changes at the customers model.
To do so, we will use Elementary's test `elementary.schema_changes`.

Lets define the schema changes test:

```yaml
models:
  - name: customers
    description: This table has basic information about a customer, as well as some derived facts based on a customer's orders
    config:
      tags: ["PII"]
    tests:
      - elementary.schema_changes
```

Now when we will run the test, it will fail when it finds a change in the model schema scence the last time it ran.

After the 2 tests we added, the schema of the customers model will look like:

```yaml
models:
  - name: customers
    description: This table has basic information about a customer, as well as some derived facts based on a customer's orders
    config:
      tags: ["PII"]
      elementary:
        timestamp_column: "signup_date"
    tests:
      - elementary.table_anomalies:
          table_anomalies:
            - row_count
      - elementary.schema_changes
```

#### 4. Dimension anomalies - orders

We want to add a test that monitors anomalous of orders for each order status.
To do so, we will use Elementary's test `elementary.dimension_anomalies`.

First lets define the dimension anomalies test, and set the status column as the dimension:

```yaml
  - name: orders
    description: This table has basic information about orders, as well as some derived facts based on payments
    config:
      tags: ["finance"]

    tests:
      - elementary.dimension_anomalies:
          dimensions:
            - status
```

Now that we defined the dimension anomalies test, lets define the timestamp column the test will run over:

```yaml
  - name: orders
    description: This table has basic information about orders, as well as some derived facts based on payments
    config:
      tags: ["finance"]
      elementary:
        timestamp_column: "order_date"

    tests:
      - elementary.dimension_anomalies:
          dimensions:
            - status
```

Now when we will run the test, it will gather row count metrics for each order status partioned over order_date column.
In case we will have an anomaly at the amount of orders for any status over the order date, the test will fail.

#### 5. Column anomalies - customers

We want to add a test that monitors anomalous of customers that have 0 orders.
To do so, we will use Elementary's test `elementary.column_anomalies`.

Lets define a `zero_count` anomaly test under the `elementary.column_anomalies` test under the customers model's column - `number_of_orders`:

```yaml
      - name: number_of_orders
        description: Count of the number of orders a customer has placed
        tests:
          - elementary.column_anomalies:
              config:
                severity: warn
              tags: ["column_anomalies"]
              column_anomalies:
                - zero_count
              timestamp_column: "signup_date"
```

<Info>

Notice that we already defined the timestamp_column at the model level, so we don't have to define it in the test.

#### Final schema

After adding all the tests, our `schema.yml` will be:
