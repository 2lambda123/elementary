title: "Setup tutorial environment"
---

In this step you will setup the environment needed for running the tutorial and using Elementary.

## Before you start

<Info> *Prerequisites*
For the tutorial you will need:
  1. Working Python installation
  2. [pip installer](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) for Python 
  3. Access and credentials to a data warehouse supported by Elementary

  We also reccomend you work with a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

## Setup tutorial dbt project

#### 1. Clone Elementary tutorial dbt project

We created a dbt project to help us with the tutorial.
The project is an extended version of the [dbt "jaffle shop" project](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop).
It contains seeds and models that we will use to run Elementary's tests on, and collect arrtifacts.

To clone the tutorial project run the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/elementary-data/tutorial.git
```

#### 2. Create profile for elementary_tutorial dbt project

Create a profile for `elementary_tutorial` at your `profiles.yml`

#### 3. Install Elementary tutorial

Elementary tutorial has a command that generates data for the tutorial.
This is important because tests needs an updated data (time wise).
In addition, when installing Elementary tutorial, we install (as a dependency) Elementary cli as well.

To install Elementary tutorial, run the following command from the cloned tutorial repository directory:

```shell
pip install -e.
```

<Info>
  
If we don't have dbt installed for our tutorial environment, we can run the following command:

```shell
pip install -e.[<warehouse type>]
```

For example:

```shell
pip install -e.[snowflake]
```

</Info>

#### 4. Generate tutorial data

To generate the data for the tutorial, run the following command:

```shell
elementary-tutorial generate-tutorial-data
```

#### 5. Create profile for Elementary's cli

If we want to run Elementary's report over our tutorial project, we should create a dbt profile for elementary.

To create a profile easily, run the following commands:

```shell
cd <tutorial cloned repository path>/elementary_tutorial/dbt_project
```

```shell
dbt run-operation elementary.generate_elementary_cli_profile
```

Copy the output, fill in the missing fields and add the profile to your `profiles.yml`.

You can see the full guide for configure Elementary profile [here](../quickstart-cli.mdx).
