title: "Running Elementary"
---

Now that we defined Elemntary's tests, it is time to run Elementary!

## Running Elementary

before we start, lets make sure that we work from our dbt project directory:

```shell
cd <tutorial cloned repository path>/elementary_tutorial/dbt_project
```

#### 1. Populate vaild data

We want to seed data to our project warehouse, so we could run Elementary and play with our tests:

```shell
dbt seed -s training
```

The next step is to run our models and create the data at our warehouse:

```shell
dbt run --vars "{'anomalies': False}"
```

<Info>

We set the anomalies flag to False, to make sure we are only seeding good data to our warehouse.

</Info>

#### 2. Running Elementary

Now that we have populated data to our warehouse, we want to run our tests and see that everything passed when our data is good and valid!

Lets run the tests:

```shell
dbt test
```

All our tests should pass!

To have a better visualisation of our test runs, lets create Elementary's report:

```shell
cli monitor report
```

#### 3. Populate broken data

Now that we saw that our tests work and everything is pass when our data is good and valid,
Lets populate broken data to our project warehouse, so we could really see how our tests work:

```shell
dbt seed -s validation
```

The next step is to run our models and create the data at our warehouse:

```shell
dbt run --vars "{'anomalies': True}"
```

<Info>

We set the anomalies flag to True, to make sure we are seeding broken data to our warehouse.

</Info>

#### 4. Running Elementary again!

Now that we have populated broken data to our warehouse, we want to run our tests and see that our tests monitor our data!

Lets run the tests:

```shell
dbt test
```

All our tests should fail!

To have a better visualisation of our test runs, lets create Elementary's report:

```shell
cli monitor report
```

#### Congratulations!

Congratulations! We successfully configured Elementary's tests & ran Elementary's Report!!!
