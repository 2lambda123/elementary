## How does it work?

The Elementary dbt package runs as part of your dbt invocations.
The package collects and stores data such as run results, test results, anomaly detection results and more.

This data is saved to an Elementary schema in the DWH.
The Elementary cloud service requires access only to this schema, to connect and generates a report UI and Slack alerts.

## Security and privacy

Elementary Managed requires access only to the Elementary schema and the tables in it.
The data in the schema in full is stored in the client's data warehouse.

We secure Elementary Managed cloud infrastructure with the highest standards.
The default retention period for any client data is one week, after which it is permanently deleted.
You can delete your account at any time, and all your configuration and reports will be deleted immediately and permanently from Elementary servers.
