We believe configuration should be managed in code.

With config-as-code you get: version control, CI, review process.
Adding and updating configuration becomes part of your development process.

Through integration and access to the dbt project code repository, Elementary opens pull requests to your dbt project.

### Coming soon - Elementary Pull request impact analysis!

When making changes to your data project, it can sometimes be hard to fully understand the impact of your changes and be certain that there are no unintended consequences.

Our impact analysis will run on every pull request in your dbt project, so that you can see the downstream impact of your changes.
You'll also be able to see if any of your dbt tests are failing or your models aren't being built successfully.

Our impact analysis will help you make changes with confidence and seeing the full picture before merging your pull request.
