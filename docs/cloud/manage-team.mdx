### Invite users

After you [signup](/cloud/onboarding/signup), you can invite team members to join you! ðŸŽ‰

On the top left button select `Account settings`, and you can invite users on the `Team` screen.

Users you invite will receive an Email saying you invited them, and will need to accept and activate their account.
