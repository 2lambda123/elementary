## Synchronizing the Elementary schema

The data you see on your Elementary cloud environments is updated by synchronizing the data from your Elementary schema. There are 2 possible scheduling settings:

1. By default, Elementary Cloud synchronizes data from your Elementary schema on an hourly basis. This means that within the one-hour time window, your data may not be up-to-date.
2. Configure a webhook that will trigger a sync after your data pipeline has finished running. 

 

## Sync Webhook


When configuring a webhook, the environment will update as soon as new data is available ensuring you see the most recent data while minimizing unnecessary updates and therefore, cost.

The sync webhook is a simple HTTP endpoint that you can call to trigger a sync of your Elementary schema, typically after your dbt job finishes.

### Setup

To configure the webhook, navigate to the relevant enivronment on your [_Environments_](https://app.elementary-data.com/settings/environments) page in Elementary Cloud. Click the environment's _Schedule Settings_ and change the environment update method to "Webhook triggered". 
The next step depends on whether you're using dbt Cloud or dbt Core.

#### dbt Cloud

In the _Schedule Settings_, you're provided with a webhook URL. Next, you will need to provide a secret token that will be returned from dbt Cloud.

Heading to dbt Cloud, you can [create a webhook subscription](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/deploy/webhooks#create-a-webhook-subscription) that would trigger a sync after your jobs are done. After completing the guide, you'll be provided with the secret token that you'll need to fill in the form on Elementary Cloud. Press _Save_ and you're done!

#### dbt Core

If you're using dbt Core and have a custom orchestration layer such as Airflow or Prefect, you can use the webhook URL and the secret generated by Elementary in the _Schedule Settings_ to trigger a sync after your dbt job.

In the following code snippet,
replace `<SECRET>` and `<WEBHOOK_URL>` with the secret and webhook URL provided in the _Schedule Settings_ and run it after your dbt job has finished.

```python
import hmac
import requests

request_body = b""
secret = b"<SECRET>"
webhook_url = "<WEBHOOK_URL>"
signature = hmac.new(secret, request_body, "sha256").hexdigest()
requests.post(webhook_url, headers={"Authorization": signature}, data=request_body)
```

Make sure to click _Save_ after filling in the form.
