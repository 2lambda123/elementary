title: "Create data warehouse user"
---

**Elementary cloud doesn't need permissions to your sensitive data.**

It is recommended to create a read only user for the elementary schema only, and provide it to Elementary Cloud in the profile.

This guild will walk you through the process of creating such a user.


# Snowflake, Redshift, Postgres

Run the following `dbt` command:
```bash
dbt run-operation create_elementary_user
```
This command will generate a query to create a user with the necessary permissions. Run this query on your data warehouse to proceed.

By default, the users name, password and role name (Snowflake) will be generated automatically, if you wish to overwrite them, you may use the following args:
```bash
dbt run-operation create_elementary_user --args '{"name": "custom_elementary_user_name", "password": "MySuperDuperStrongPassword123", "role": "custom_elementary_role"}'
```


# BigQuery
As BigQuery doesn't support creating users through SQL, you will need to create a service account manually, you may want to consult the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview).

Create a service acount with the following permissions:
 * query on all the tables in your `elementary` schema (usually `<dbt_schema>_elementary`)
 * query on the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` of your `dbt_schema`

After creating the account, use its `keyfile.json` when configuring the profile in elementary cloud. 


# Databricks
As with BigQuery, Databricks doesn't support creating users through SQL, you will need to create a service principal manually, you may want to consult the [documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/users.html).

Create a service principal with the following permissions:
 * read on all the tables in your `elementary` schema (usually `<dbt_schema>_elementary`)
