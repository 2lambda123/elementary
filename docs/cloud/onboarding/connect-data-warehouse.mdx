You can connect Elementary to a data warehouse that has an Elementary schema (created by the [Elementary dbt package](/cloud/onboarding/quickstart-dbt-package)).

Here are the steps needed to enable the connection: 

### Authentication and IP Allowlist

Elementary needs authentication details, permissions to read the Elementary schema (and not the rest of your data), and network access enabled by adding the cloud IPs to your data warehouse allowlist. 

Elementary IP for allowlist: `3.126.156.226`

### Create a `profiles.yml` file

You will need to provide the connection and authentication details by uploading a YML file with a connection profile named `elementary`.
The profile needs to point at the database and schema name where your elementary tables are. 

The easiest way to generate the profile is to run the following command within the dbt project where you deployed the elementary dbt package (works in dbt cloud as well):

```shell
dbt run-operation elementary.generate_elementary_cli_profile
```

Save the output to a YML file, update the missing details, and you are ready. 

Here are the formats of profile for each supported data warehouse:

<Snippet file="profiles/all-profiles.mdx" />


### Connect Elementary cloud

On the `Account settings` under `Integrations`, press `Connect` on the "Connect Your data warehouse" section.

Provide an env name, select a data warehouse type, and upload the `profiles.yml` file with the `elementary` profile.
