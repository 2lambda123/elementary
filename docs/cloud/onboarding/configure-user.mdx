To run Elementary cloud, you will need to provide connection info to a user with access to your elementary schema.
You can configure the user by yourself, or use [our guild](/cloud/onboarding/create-data-warehouse-user/create-data-warehouse-user) to create the user automatically.

### Permissions and security

**Elementary cloud doesn't need permissions to your sensitive data.**

It is recommended to create a read only user for the elementary schema only, and provide it to Elementary Cloud.
For more details, refer to [security and privacy](/cloud/security-and-privacy).
