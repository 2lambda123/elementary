Elementary Managed is a cloud service that offers orchestration and hosting of Elementary as a service.

*The service is currently in private beta, you can [contact us](mailto:team@elementary-data.com) for details.*

## How it works?

The Elementary dbt package runs as part of your dbt invocations. 
The package collects and stores data such as run results, test results, anomaly detection results and more.

This data is saved to an Elementary schema in the DWH.
The cloud service requires access only to this schema.
Once every day / hour the cloud reads the new data from the schema, and generates a report UI and Slack alerts.
