To start using Elementary to monitor you dbt tests, executions and data, you need to add our dbt package to your dbt project.

<summary className="font-medium cursor-default select-none text-slate-900 dark:text-slate-200">What are dbt packages and packages.yml?</summary>

A dbt package is additional Jinja and SQL code that is added to your project, for additional functionality. In fact, each package is a dbt project. By adding a package to your project, you are adding the package code to be part of your project, you can reference it's macros, execute it's models, and so on.

Add packages to your project by creating a 'packages.yml' file under the main project directory (where your 'dbt_project.yml is), and adding the relevant package. After you add a new package, run dbt deps to actually pull it's code to your project. This is also how you update packages.
Some packages we recommend you check out: [dbt_utils](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils/tree/0.8.2/), [dbt_date](https://github.com/calogica/dbt-date/tree/0.5.4/), [codegen](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/tree/0.5.0/).

### What happens now?

Once the elementary dbt package has been installed and configured, your test results, run results and [dbt artifacts](./guides/dbt-artifacts) will be loaded to elementary schema tables.

If you see data in these models you completed the package deployment (Congrats!ðŸŽ‰).

## What's next?

1. [â€‹Add data anomaly detection dbt tests](./quickstart/add-elementary-tests)ðŸ“ˆ
2. [â€‹Install the Elementary CLI](./quickstart/generate-report-ui#install-the-elementary-cli) to:

   - [â€‹Visualize all dbt test results and runs in a report](./quickstart/generate-report-ui)âœ¨

   - [Send informative Slack alerts](../quickstart/send-slack-alerts)ðŸ“£
