<Accordion title="How test configurations are prioritized?">

The configuration of Elementary is dbt native and follows the same priorities of `dbt configuration`.
Elementary searches and prioritizes configuration in the following order:

1. Test arguments.
2. Model `config` (timestamp_column only).
3. Global vars in `dbt_project.yml`.
