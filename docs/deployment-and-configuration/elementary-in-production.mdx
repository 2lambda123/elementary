title: "Elementary in production"
---

Running Elementary in production means to include the dbt package in your production dbt project, 
and setting up automation to run the CLI on a schedule.

You can choose any system that allows you to orchestrate a CLI execution, as long as it can meet the following requirements:
- Full installation of Elementary CLI and dependencies (including dependencies from dbt packages hub). 
- Network access to the data warehouse.
- Access to a `profiles.yml` file with connection details under `elementary` profile name.
- The connection details of the profile need to have read and write permissions to the Elementary schema.  

## Elementary production deployment and jobs 

Your deployment of Elementary has two parts:

*Part 1 - Elementary package in your production dbt project*

In your dbt jobs, after you deploy the Elementary dbt package: 
1. Run and test tesults - Collected by default as part of your runs.
2. Elementary tests - Make sure your dbt test runs include elementary tests. 
3. Update dbt artifacts - Elementary uses the dbt artifacts models to enrich the report, alerts and lineage. To update the artifacts data, run the elementary dbt artifacts models. 


*Part 2 - Elementary CLI*

On an orchestration system of your choice, run the CLI to:
1. Send Slack alerts - Use the `edr monitor` command and Slack integration.
2. Generate a report - Use the `edr monitor report` or `edr monitor send-report` that has built in support for sending the report to Slack / GCS / S3.

## When to run Elementary?

For sending alerts or generating a report, there are two options:

1. Run Elementary CLI after each relevant dbt job (`dbt test` / `dbt build` / `dbt run`).
2. Run Elementary CLI periodically in a frequency that fits your dbt job executions.

To make sure your project data is updated, we recommend running the elementary dbt artifacts models on each PR merge to your dbt production project:  
```shell
dbt run --select dbt_models dbt_tests dbt_sources dbt_snapshots dbt_metrics dbt_exposures
```

## Ways to run Elementary in production

If your organization is using dbt-core, it would probably be a good choice to orchestrate Elementary using the same system that orchestrates dbt.

Any automation server / orchestration tool supports running a CLI tool like Elementary.

Some options include: 

1. GitHub Actions - Checkout the [Elementary GitHub Action workflow](https://github.com/elementary-data/run-elementary-action) we created.
2. Airflow
3. Prefect
5. Using cron
