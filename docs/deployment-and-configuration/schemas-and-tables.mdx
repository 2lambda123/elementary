# Elementary dbt package models

## Run results

### dbt_run_results 
*Incremental model*

Run results of dbt invocations, inserted at the end of each invocation.
Each row is the invocation result of a single resource (model, test, snapshot, etc).
New data is loaded to this model on an on-run-end hook named `elementary.upload_run_results` from each invocation that produces a result object.

### model_run_results 
*View*

Run results of dbt models, enriched with models metadata.
Each row is the result of a single model.
This is a view that joins data from `dbt_run_results` and `dbt_models`.

### snapshot_run_results
*View*

Run results of dbt snapshots, enriched with snapshots metadata.
Each row is the result of a single snapshot.
This is a view that joins data from `dbt_run_results` and `dbt_snapshots`.

### elementary_test_results
*Incremental model*

Run results of all dbt tests, with fields and metadata needed to produce the [Elementary report](../understand-elementary/elementary-report-ui). 
Each row is the result of a single test, including native dbt tests, packages tests and elementary tests.
New data is loaded to this model on an on-run-end hook named `elementary.handle_tests_results`.


## dbt artifacts

The dbt artifacts models are created as empty tables, and a post-hook macro inserts data from the dbt graph object to the table.
**Each time the model is executed, the data is replaced with the projectâ€™s current graph.**
It is recommended to execute these models every time a change is merged to the project.

### dbt_models
*Table*

Metadata about all the models in the project and project packages. 
Each row contains information about the properties of a single model, including columns like tags, owner, materialization, depends_on, and description.

### dbt_tests
*Table*

Metadata about all the tests in the project and project packages.
Each row contains information about the properties of a single test, including columns like severity, parent model unique id, tags and owner of the parent model, test params, and the test compiled query.

### dbt_sources
*Table*

Metadata about the sources configured in the project and project packages. 
Each row contains information about the properties of a single source, including columns like tags, owner, freshness configuration, database and schema.

### dbt_exposures
*Table*

Metadata about the exposures configured in the project and project packages. 
Each row contains information about the properties of a single exposure, including columns like tags, owner, url and depends on.

### dbt_metrics
*Table*

Metadata about the metrics configured in the project and project packages. 
Each row contains information about the properties of a single metric, including columns like tags, owner, sql, and depends on.

### dbt_snapshots
*Table*

Metadata about all the snapshots in the project and project packages.
Each row contains information about the properties of a single snapshot, including columns like tags, owner, depends_on, and description.


## Alerts views

### alerts_dbt_models
*View*

A view that is used by the Elementary CLI to generate models alerts, including all the fields the alert will include such as owner, tags, error message, etc.
It joins data about models and snapshots run results, and filters alerts according to configuration.

### alerts_dbt_tests
*View*

A view that is used by the Elementary CLI to generate dbt tests alerts, including all the fields the alert will include such as owner, tags, error message, etc.
This view includes data about all dbt tests except elementary tests.
It filters alerts according to configuration.

### alerts_anomaly_detection
*View*

A view that is used by the Elementary CLI to generate alerts on data anomalies detected using the elementary anomaly detection tests.
The view filters alerts according to configuration.

### alerts_schema_changes
*View*

A view that is used by the Elementary CLI to generate alerts on schema changes detected using elementary tests.
The view filters alerts according to configuration.

## Anomaly detection

### data_monitoring_metrics
*Incremental model*


## Schema changes

### schema_columns_snapshot
*Incremental model*

Stores the schema details for tables that are monitored with elementary schema changes test.
In order to compare current schema to previous state, we must store the previous state.
The data is from a view that queries the data warehouse information schema.

### filtered_information_schema_columns
*View*

Queries the columns view from the information schema of the schemas in the project.
This view is generated using an adapter specific macro, as information schema is different between platforms.
This is a view to make the work with the information schema more convinient.

### filtered_information_schema_tables
*View*

Queries the tables and schemas views from the information schema of the schemas in the project.
This view is generated using an adapter specific macro, as information schema is different between platforms.
This is a view to make the work with the information schema more convinient.
