After installing Elementary's dbt package upon running `dbt deps`,
you can generate Elementary's profile for usage with `edr` by running the following command within your project:

```shell
dbt run-operation elementary.generate_elementary_cli_profile
```

The command will print to the terminal a partially filled template of the profile that's needed for `edr` to work.
[Fill in the missing authentication fields]({props.profileDocsLink})
in the output and copy it to `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`.
