## Install Elementary CLI

To install the monitor module run:

```shell
pip install elementary-data
```

Run one of the following commands based on your platform (no need to run all):

```shell
pip install 'elementary-data[snowflake]'
pip install 'elementary-data[bigquery]'
pip install 'elementary-data[redshift]'
pip install 'elementary-data[databricks]'
```

Run `edr --help` in order to ensure the installation was successful.

### Integrate dbt project

Upon running `edr`, please make sure to `cd` into the root of your dbt project.
Alternatively, you can provide the `--project-dir` argument to specify its path.
This is required so that `edr` will be able to get the most up-to-date state of your project such as models, tests,
snapshots, their owners, tags, etc.

If you're receiving `command not found: edr` please check our [troubleshooting guide](/general/troubleshooting).
