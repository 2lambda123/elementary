## Install Elementary CLI

To install the monitor module run:

```shell
pip install elementary-data
```

Run one of the following commands based on your platform (no need to run all):

```shell
pip install 'elementary-data[snowflake]'
pip install 'elementary-data[bigquery]'
pip install 'elementary-data[redshift]'
```

Generate Elementary's profile for usage with `edr` by running the following command within your Dbt project:

```shell
dbt run-operation elementary.generate_elementary_cli_profile
```

Fill in the missing fields and afterwards add the profile to your `profiles.yml`.

Run `edr --help` in order to ensure the installation was successful.

If you're receiving `command not found: edr` please check our [troubleshooting guide](../general/troubleshooting).
