## Data anomalies monitoring as dbt tests

Full support since version 0.4.0.

## Redshift connection profile

The profiles.yml file to connect to Snowflake should contain a profile in the following format:

```yml Redshift
## REDSHIFT ##
## By default, edr expects the profile name 'elementary'.      ##
## Configure the database and schema of elementary models.     ##
## Check where 'elementary_test_results' is to find it.        ##

elementary:
  outputs:
    default:
      type: redshift
      host: [hostname, like hostname.region.redshift.amazonaws.com]

      ## User/password auth, other options (IAM) require other configs ##
      user: [username]
      password: [password]

      dbname: [database name]
      schema: [schema name]  # elementary schema, usually [schema name]_elementary
      threads: 4
      keepalives_idle: 240 # default 240 seconds
      connect_timeout: 10 # default 10 seconds
      # search_path: public # optional, not recommended
      sslmode: [optional, set the sslmode used to connect to the database (in case this parameter is set, will look for ca in ~/.postgresql/root.crt)]
      ra3_node: true # enables cross-database sources
```

We support the same format and connection methods (user password, key pair authentication, SSO) as dbt. Please refer to dbt's documentation of [Redshift profile](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/redshift-profile) for further details.
