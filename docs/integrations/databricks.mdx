## Partial Support

Currently, Elementary Databricks integration is partial, and supports:

1. Installing the dbt package to upload dbt artifacts, test results and run results.
2. Data observability report generation.
3. Slack alerts on failures in models and tests.

Elementary anomaly detection tests are **not supported yet**.

## Databricks connection profile

<GenerateElementaryCLIProfile profileDocsLink="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/warehouse-profiles/databricks-profile#set-up-a-databricks-target" />

The `profiles.yml` file to connect to Databricks should contain a profile in the following format:

```yml Redshift
## DATABRICKS ##
## By default, edr expects the profile name 'elementary'.      ##

elementary:
  outputs:
    default:
      type: databricks
      host: [hostname, like <ID>.cloud.databricks.com]
      http_path: [like /sql/1.0/endpoints/<ID>]
      token : [token]
      threads: [number of threads like 8]
```
