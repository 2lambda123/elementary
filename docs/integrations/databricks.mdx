## Partial Support

Currently, Elementary only supports Dbt artifacts on Databricks.


## Databricks connection profile

After installing Elementary's dbt package upon running `dbt deps`,
you can generate Elementary's profile for usage with `edr` by running the following command within your project:
```shell
dbt run-operation elementary.generate_elementary_cli_profile
```

Fill in the missing fields and afterwards add the profile to your `profiles.yml`.

The `profiles.yml` file to connect to Databricks should contain a profile in the following format:

```yml Redshift
## DATABRICKS ##
## By default, edr expects the profile name 'elementary'.      ##

elementary:
  outputs:
    default:
      type: databricks
      host: [hostname, like <ID>.cloud.databricks.com]
      http_path: [like /sql/1.0/endpoints/<ID>]
      token : [token]
      threads: [number of threads like 8]
```
